A comprehensive demonstration of different approaches to implementing GraphQL with Spring Boot, showcasing three popular libraries and their unique features.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains three independent Spring Boot applications that demonstrate different approaches to implementing GraphQL APIs. Each application implements the same domain model (Organization ‚Üí Department ‚Üí Employee hierarchy) using different GraphQL libraries, allowing for direct comparison of approaches and features.

## üóÑÔ∏è Domain Model

The application models a simple organizational structure:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Organization ||--o{ Department : contains
    Department ||--o{ Employee : contains
    Organization ||--o{ Employee : employs
    
    Organization {
        int id
        string name
    }
    
    Department {
        int id
        string name
        int organization_id
    }
    
    Employee {
        int id
        string firstName
        string lastName
        string position
        int salary
        int age
        int department_id
        int organization_id
    }
```

    # Department queries
    departments: [Department]
    department(id: ID!): Department!
    
    # Employee queries
    employees: [Employee]
    employee(id: ID!): Employee!
    employeesWithFilter(filter: EmployeeFilter): [Employee]
}

type Mutation {
    # Organization mutations
    newOrganization(organization: OrganizationInput!): Organization
    
    # Department mutations
    newDepartment(department: DepartmentInput!): Department
    
    # Employee mutations
    newEmployee(employee: EmployeeInput!): Employee
}

type Organization {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    employees: [Employee]
    departments: [Department]
}

type Department {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    organization: Organization
    employees: [Employee]
}

type Employee {
    id: ID!
    firstName: String!
    lastName: String!
    position: String!
    salary: Int
    age: Int
    department: Department
    organization: Organization
}

input EmployeeFilter {
    salary: FilterField
    age: FilterField
    position: FilterField
}

input FilterField {
    operator: String!  # eq, gt, lt, gte, lte, ne
    value: String!
}
```
